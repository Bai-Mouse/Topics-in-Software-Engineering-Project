## Project Pitch
A Clinic Management System

## Project Description
Clinic IQ The Clinic Queue Management System is a web-based platform designed to improve patient flow and streamline clinic operations. Patients can remotely check in, complete intake forms online, and view real-time queue updates, reducing uncertainty and wait times. Clinic staff can manage patient queues, assign personnel, coordinate room usage, and track essential medical inventory such as PPE, X-rays, ECG/EKG, and more through a centralized dashboard. Built as a flexible and general-purpose solution, the system can be tailored to the workflow of any outpatient clinic. This software is intended to be deployable to any clinic. By integrating queue management, personnel scheduling, and inventory tracking in a single platform, the system aims to reduce bottlenecks, improve resource utilization, and enhance patient experience in high-demand healthcare environments.
